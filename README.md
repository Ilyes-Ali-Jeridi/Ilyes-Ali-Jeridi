## üöÄ Latest Project: AI in Mining Engineering

**From Father's Challenge to AI Breakthrough**  

*"Ilyes, what can we do about these problems I have?"*  

This question from my dad, a mining engineer with decades of experience, inspired the development of a **real-world AI solution for blast plan optimization** in mining.  

**AI Revolution in Mining**  
- **Meta's SAM (Segment Anything Model):** Detects thousands of rock fragments in seconds with human-level accuracy.  
- **XGBoost Gradient Boosting:** Learns from every blast with 26+ engineered features.  
- **Real-Time ML Monitoring:** Detects performance drift and recommends retraining automatically.  
- **Intelligent Feature Engineering:** Creates complex feature interactions humans may miss.  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Predicts outcomes with confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification.

**AI Performance Metrics**  
- 2-second AI inference for complex fragmentation analysis.  
- 90%+ prediction accuracy with continuous learning.  
- Automated quality scoring and confidence assessment.  
- Zero-shot learning ‚Äì works immediately without historical data.  
- Self-healing models adapting to changing rock conditions.  

**Built With:** Python AI Stack (XGBoost, SAM, scikit-learn), FastAPI, React, TypeScript  
**GitHub Repo:** [Mining AI Project](https://lnkd.in/dA_q_Y2X)
